# online-chatroom
This is a duo-assignment for the Array Bootcamp to help with Sprint #3 of Array, which is the 4th and 5th week the students spend here at Array! This assignment will have the students create a complete online chatroom utilizing React, Redux, NodeJS and ExpressJS. Once again, the **interface** is completely you and your partner's choosing. Your chatroom will feature several different components!

### Technologies Required

- React
- React Router
- Redux
- NodeJS
- SocketIO
- ExpressJS
- React Bootstrap

## Requirements

1. You must have the ability for a user to access a website and see the interface. 
2. They can set their own username when joining the website. 
3. They can set their own avatar when joining the website. 
4. You can type into the chatbox and have a conversation with your partner. 
5. The user should be able to select a background color for their messages and it automatically makes the text either white or black.
6. All users should be able to see who is in the chatroom (a list of users somewhere on the interface).

## Bonus #1

Make the chatroom even better by creating "private messages" between two users. You can click their username from the list of users and then select "private message" to open a private message with the user. You can then type and have a private conversation. 

## Bonus #2

Even further improve the chatbox by adding a "{Username} is typing..." indicator to the chatbox system. So if someone is typing, it should show they're typing. If multiple people are typing, it should show the first two and then say "{firstUsername}, {secondUsername} and {x} others are typing..." to signal that multiple users are typing. 

Example: "Matt, Justice and 5 others are typing..." 

#### There are no additional tasks for this assignment as I believe these tasks will take all of the available time.
