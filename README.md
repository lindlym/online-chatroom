# Online Chatroom/Discord Clone
This is another project for the Array Bootcamp to help with Sprint #3 of Array! This assignment will have the students create a complete online chat solution utilizing React, Redux, NodeJS and ExpressJS. Once again, the **interface** is completely up to the group's discretion. Your chatroom will feature several different components, it will have a **homepage**, an **about** page and finally the full **chatbox** page!

### Technologies Required

- React
- React Router
- Redux
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- React Bootstrap
- SocketIO (Self-Research)
- Heroku CLI & Deployment (Self-Research)

## Homepage Requirements
Please choose a theme and make the homepage based on that theme. 

1. Just some general information about what your chatbox discussion is for. 
2. A general navigation element at the top, as well as making the homepage look as graphically nice as possible.

## About Requirements

1. Just another about page which includes the two authors information of the website.

## Chatroom/Discord Clone Requirements

1. The user should be able to access the site and see a general chatroom that they can access. 
2. They can optionally choose to create their own chatroom that users will be able to see.
3. They should be able to set their chatroom to private or public, the private version only being accessible by using a specific code.
4. After selecting a chatbox, the user can set their own username for the chatroom. 
5. They can set their own avatar as well.
6. You can type into the chatbox and have a conversation (this is demonstrated with your partner).
7. The user should be able to select a background color for their messages and it automatically makes the text either white or black.
8. All users should be able to see who is in the chatroom (a list of users somewhere on the interface).

**NOTE: The site will be deployed to Heroku, the naming for the URL will be `<theme-name>-chatroom.herokuapp.com`, where theme-name is a name decided by your group. This will be a deployment process that YOU WILL RESEARCH ON YOUR OWN! t will not be covered in class, you'll learn how to deploy it from the CLI!**

## Bonus #1

Make the chatroom even better by creating "private messages" between two users. You can click their username from the list of users and then select "private message" to open a private message with the user. You can then type and have a private conversation. This can either be part of the interface, or some kind of "instant messaging" chat window that appears.

## Bonus #2

Further improve the chatbox by adding a "{Username} is typing..." indicator to the chatbox system. So if someone is typing, it should show they're typing... If multiple people are typing, it should show the first two and then say "{firstUsername}, {secondUsername} and {x} others are typing..." to signal that multiple users are typing. 

Example: "Matt, Savannah and 5 others are typing..." 

#### There are no additional tasks for this assignment as I believe these tasks will take all of the available time.
